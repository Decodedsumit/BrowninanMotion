Matlab Script to simulate elastic collision of particles

Hi there,
This Matlab code is written to simulate 2D elastic collision of particles as a part of one of my courseworks during Masters. 

The user is asked to enter the following data:
1. Length of each side of the enclosure.
2. Number of particles to be injected.
3. Angle of particle injection (degrees)
4. Velocity of injection (m/s)

There are 3 files to attached,
1. box.m  // Creates the desired size of the enclosure by the user.
2. Collision_Particles.m // The main function of the whole code which computates the motion.
3. Input_circle.m // Responsibe for the creating particles of size input by the user.

Happy Scripting.!!! 
# Any Improvisations are highly appreciated.
